# Python-UDP-Flood
Very basic DOS attack made with python.

It can be converted into a DDOS attack using multiple computers.

I'm not responsible for the use you give using this program.

 It Supports UDP and TCP

## Usage
download or copy the script of rundos.sh

Maybe you should do it to make it work.
```bash
chmod +x rundos.sh
```

### Auto-Install Script
```bash 
wget -O runddos.sh 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fernandesrobert/PPRT-DDOS/master/rundos.sh' && chmod +x runddos.sh && ./runddos.sh
```
After running this code and want to open it again just do:
```bash
./ddos.sh
```
And if you want an auto-update bash script (I don't think it would be updated too much)
take the Auto-Install Script and put it inside a .sh file

### Windows
If you are on windows install Python3 and download the script udpflood.py open a powershell window or cmd
```bash
python3 udpflood.py
```
